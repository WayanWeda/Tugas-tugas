<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2016</p>
<p>This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about a new cooking technique called <i>Sous Vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerged the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <i>Cooking for Greeks</i>. Jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature-poaching".</p>

<p>Next Month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserves seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>

<p>Location: <br>Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA<br></p>
